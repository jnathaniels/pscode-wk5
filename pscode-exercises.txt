// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

function addTwoNums(a, b) {

    return a + b

}

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

function evenOrOdd(num) {
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        return "even"
    }
    else {
        return "odd"
    }
}

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

    var myNumArray[] = {1, 4, 3, 2, 5} 
    var average = 0.0
    var sum = 0.0

    for (num in myNumArray) {
        sum += num
    }

    average = sum / myNumArray.length
